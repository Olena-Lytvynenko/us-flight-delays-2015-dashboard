# Dashboard: US Flight Delays and Cancellations (2015)

**Project Goal:** Analyze the main reasons behind flight delays and cancellations in the US in 2015.  
**Data Source:** [Kaggle ‚Äî US DOT Flight Delays Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv)

---

## What is this project?

This is a study project created during a data visualization course.  
The main task was to build an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore **key causes of flight delays and cancellations**, with filtering options by **time**, **airports**, **airlines**, and **states**.

---

## Why data preprocessing was necessary

The original dataset showed that a single flight may have **multiple delay reasons**.  
Tableau cannot natively handle such ‚Äúone-to-many‚Äù relationships without prior transformation.

As an analyst, I chose to preprocess the data in **Python using Pandas** ‚Äî a common and practical step when preparing datasets for dashboards.

---

## Data preparation steps in Pandas

The following transformations were applied:

- Created unique identifiers for each flight
- Extracted and normalized delay reasons, flight numbers, and delay time
- Created a dedicated table for the **Sankey diagram** (by month and delay type)
- Mapped numeric months to their textual names
- Sorted and exported final tables for Tableau

 *All steps can be reproduced in the notebook `data_preparation_for_dashboard.ipynb`.*

## Project structure

The project uses a simplified version of the original Kaggle data:

- `flights_light.csv` ‚Äî simplified flight data  
- `airlines.csv` ‚Äî airline reference  
- `airports.csv` ‚Äî airport reference  

For Tableau integration:

- `airports.csv` is joined **twice** ‚Äî once for departure, once for arrival  
- Each instance is renamed to avoid naming conflicts  
- Relationships between tables are manually configured in Tableau

## What the dashboard shows

The dashboard includes the following elements:

1. **Interactive Filter Panel**  
   Allows switching between delay and cancellation data via a parameter toggle, and filtering by airline, airport, state, date, year, month, and weekday.  
  
2. **Key Metrics**  
   Displays total number of flights, share of delays and cancellations, and share of delays over 15 minutes.  
   Monthly data is shown using line charts.

3. **‚ÄúTaxi In vs Out‚Äù Diagram**  
   Compares average taxi-in and taxi-out time per month.

4. **Donut Chart: Delay/Cancellation Reasons**  
   Breakdown by cause: Late Aircraft, Airline, Weather, NAS, Security.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Linked to the Delay/Cancellation selector.*

5. **Top 10 Airports by Incidents**  
   Horizontal bar chart sorted by number of delays or cancellations.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Linked to the Delay/Cancellation selector.*

6. **Barplot: Delay & Cancellation Causes**  
   Comparison of delay/cancellation counts by category (Airline, Weather, etc.).  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Linked to the Delay/Cancellation selector.*

7. **‚ÄúAirlines Delay & Cancellation‚Äù Chart**  
   Compares delay and cancellation rates per airline in a single chart.

8. **Delay vs Cancellation Over Time**  
   Combined chart showing average delay and cancellation share by month.

9. **US State Map**  
   Bubble map showing the number of incidents per state (size and color intensity).  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Linked to the Delay/Cancellation selector.*

10. **Heatmap: Delays & Cancellations**  
    Visualizes distribution by weekday and hour.  
    ‚ö†Ô∏è *Linked to the Delay/Cancellation selector.*

11. **Textual Explanation**  
    Helps users interpret the dashboard and understand key insights.

## Why this is useful

This visualization allows quick detection of:

- Problematic **airports** and time slots  
- Less reliable **airlines**  
- Dependency of **delays on time of day, day of week, or month**  
- Major **root causes** like weather, late arrivals, or operational issues

---

## Who may benefit from this project?

- **Junior analysts** ‚Äî as a reference for data prep and dashboarding  
- **Airlines and airports** ‚Äî as a prototype for issue monitoring  
- **HR & recruiters** ‚Äî to evaluate Tableau, Python, and data skills

## How to use

1. Download the source data from Kaggle  
2. Run the notebook `data_preparation_for_dashboard.ipynb`  
3. Load prepared CSV files into Tableau  
4. Recreate table relationships (see diagram above)  
5. Explore the dashboard or customize it as needed
